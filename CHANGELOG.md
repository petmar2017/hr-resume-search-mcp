## Version History

### Versioning Strategy
- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking API changes, major architectural changes
- **Minor (0.X.0)**: New features, non-breaking changes
- **Patch (0.0.X)**: Bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation updates

### Release Schedule
- **Production Releases**: Monthly
- **Staging Releases**: Weekly
- **Development Releases**: Continuous

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 0.x to 1.0
1. Update Python to 3.12 if not already using it
2. Run database migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
3. Update environment variables according to .env.example
4. Update API endpoints to /api/v1 prefix
5. Regenerate JWT tokens with new secret key

## Deprecated Features

### To be removed in 2.0.0
- None yet

## Known Issues

### Current Issues
- **TODO-001 to TODO-043**: See implementation_plan.md for complete list
- File processing limited to 10MB per file
- Maximum 10 concurrent resume processing tasks

### Workarounds
- For files larger than 10MB, split into multiple uploads
- For high-volume processing, implement queue management
